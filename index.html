Are the heavier versions longer? Simple variation? I couldn't find anything regarding this on the official homepage.</p> <p>I'm mainly considering the Concave versions. However, lately I have been more attentive to the way I slightly shift my grip (sometimes) when playing BH and started to think about how this would feel like with a straight blade.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Davidsn"> /u/Davidsn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10lpr26/yasaka_sweden_extra_weight_options/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10lpr26/yasaka_sweden_extra_weight_options/">[comments]</a></span></summary>

But now I bought a Joola spring net, that is supposed to be ITTF approved. I put some tension on the cord as usual but it seems that I overdid it. The net didn't sit tight at the table any more. The attachment bent upwards a little and no longer sat on the table flat, so the net was too high.

      <summary><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It's not news to us that the use of wrists is very important when it comes to playing table tennis, whether it is a push or a flick, a chop-block or a loop. Today I want to focus on loops.</p> <p>The use of the wrist in loops not only help with the direction of the ball but also the quality of spin you put on the ball, which is my main focus for this post.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrVfYAYtMxU">Timo's video</a> on forehand topspin, he mentions using the wrist and forearm at the right moment, in other videos (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/4KThMnP3Azs">Tabletennisdaily</a>) they also mentioned the same thing as well.</p> <p>I notice in my forehand topspins, I don't &quot;intentionally&quot; use the wrist but I would let it be loose and then the same motion as Timo mentioned when I contact the ball. I tried to intentionally remind myself to use the wrist the other day and funnily enough, I couldn't hit anything.</p> <p>But for my backhand, I intentionally use it all the time and only stop using it if my form is not good that day and I need to slow down and get my form right first.</p> <p>I'm thinking that both forehand and backhand require the wrist to be loose and steady, but because the forehand requires more swinging space it is more natural to not focus too much on the wrist or else you might miss the contact point; for the backhand, the swinging space is much smaller and thus it is much easier to decide if you are going to use the wrist.</p> <p>Do you guys use your wrist on the forehand more or backhand more or equally a lot? Vote in the polls and let's discuss in the comments!</p> <p>Edit: I should mention that, when I'm talking about my experience in the 4th paragraph, I &quot;do&quot; use my body as well, but because I'm talking about the wrist action, I'm only focused on that, not meaning other parts aren't important.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/poll/10l0ac7">View Poll</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/PrimeMover_632"> /u/PrimeMover_632 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10l0ac7/use_your_wrist_or_not/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10l0ac7/use_your_wrist_or_not/">[comments]</a></span></summary>

I am using Butterfly Free Chack, how many layers of glue should I put on the rubber sponge? Guideline says one layer on rubber, one on the blade, but I saw many videos when someone use 2 layers. Also opinions for pressing the racket after gluing differs, some say to use press or put racket between some heavy books, some do not use any press at all.

      <summary><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tried my friend's setup (similar blade to my own, 5-play all wood) and ended up loving H3 on backhand. This is the red package, not the green-packaged &quot;NEO&quot; version. I had always read you needed some special unobtainable technique to make proper use of this rubber or it would feel &quot;dead&quot;, but it instantly improved several of my techniques.</p> <p>My current setup is a Tibhar Stratus Power Wood blade with Nittaku Fastarc G1 (max) on forehand and Rakza Z (2.0) on backhand. The Rakza Z was bought for forehand but I ended up liking it far more for backhand.</p> <p>The H3 seems to improve on everything I like about the Rakza Z, like the Z was just a gateway-drug to the H3. My short game and flicks are just easier to control with H3. In particular, my banana flick to the opponents forehand corner (right-handed) is significantly easier to land.</p> <p>When stepping back from the table and looping, I found it easier to control, as well. It's slower than what I originally had which was Rakza 7 Soft, but it's not noticeably slower than Rakza Z. Again, I had more control and really had no problem having enough power to hit winners. More confidence will usually result in more power.</p> <p>Here's the big one. Chop-blocks were far more controllable. This one I'm particularly excited about because my chop-blocks are very effectiveâ€¦when they land. Well, they were landing all night with H3.</p> <p>So, my setup is backhand finesse with the H3 and forehand power with the Fastarc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Fidel_Blastro"> /u/Fidel_Blastro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10kbigs/so_i_had_unexpected_results_with_dhs_hurricane_3/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10kbigs/so_i_had_unexpected_results_with_dhs_hurricane_3/">[comments]</a></span></summary>

      <summary><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I'm planning to buy a carbon blade for the first time, mostly for experiencing with carbon blade, but I also want to save it as an upgrade of my YEO for playing seriously with once my techniques are more solid. </p> <p>Currently I'm using a YEO with Battle 2 national (39 degree) on FH and Rakza 7 on BH. I don't have a formal rating but guess my level is on the lower intermediate spectrum. My playing style is close to the table with a mix of top spin openings (FH or RPB) and TPB blocks (somewhat passive since I just often wait for the opponent to open first and then use placement block and/or counter, I'm working on playing more active tho). Some of the blades that come to my mind include: - Viscaria CS ver: I had a chance to play with this for abt 5 mins, the feel is very different from my YEO, will need some time to adjust but at least top spins are very satisfying (using 60-70% of my power and it's already as fast as my loop using 90% power with YEO). - Harimoto inner ALC CS ver: Seems to be great at blocking, but not sure about TPB? - Sanwei 75, I'm considering both inner and outer version. - Nittaku acoustic carbon (outer &amp; inner)</p> <p>My budget is around the price of Viscaria. Any input is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/commoner9x"> /u/commoner9x </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10jvqud/carbon_blade_recommendation_for_penhold/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10jvqud/carbon_blade_recommendation_for_penhold/">[comments]</a></span></summary>

      <summary><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, I am looking to upgrade my paddle and need some feedback.</p> <p>I am an intermediate level player (somewhere between 1100-1300 rating in USA). I play regularly at local university club. My current setup is:FH: Tenergy 05BH: Xiom Vega ProBlade: the stock blade that comes with Yasaka <a href="https://www.megaspin.net/store/product-reviews.asp?pid=y-gat-mv-c">Mark V Carbon</a></p> <p>I am happy with the rubbers, but considering whether I should upgrade the blade to Donic Waldner Senso (either the normal or the JO shape - I don't know what the difference is though) or not. If anyone has experience with both he Yasaka and Donic blades, I would appreciate your feedback.</p> <p>Some more background: I have been playing with this paddle for &gt; 5 years. I last changed the rubbers more than 4 years ago, but the paddle was well stored and I didn't play much during covid, so didn't feel like upgrading until now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/the_boy_who_believed"> /u/the_boy_who_believed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10iz8q6/to_upgrade_or_not_to_upgrade_the_blade/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10iz8q6/to_upgrade_or_not_to_upgrade_the_blade/">[comments]</a></span></summary>
