I play regularly at local university club. My current setup is:FH: Tenergy 05BH: Xiom Vega ProBlade: the stock blade that comes with Yasaka <a href="https://www.megaspin.net/store/product-reviews.asp?pid=y-gat-mv-c">Mark V Carbon</a></p> <p>I am happy with the rubbers, but considering whether I should upgrade the blade to Donic Waldner Senso (either the normal or the JO shape - I don't know what the difference is though) or not. If anyone has experience with both he Yasaka and Donic blades, I would appreciate your feedback.</p> <p>Some more background: I have been playing with this paddle for &gt; 5 years. I last changed the rubbers more than 4 years ago, but the paddle was well stored and I didn't play much during covid, so didn't feel like upgrading until now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/the_boy_who_believed"> /u/the_boy_who_believed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10iz8q6/to_upgrade_or_not_to_upgrade_the_blade/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10iz8q6/to_upgrade_or_not_to_upgrade_the_blade/">[comments]</a></span></summary>

I've used Medium &amp; Soft on a blade which used to be a premade racket, I'd say it belongs in the ALL+ class.</p> <p>I've assembled the setup for months already but only recently had a more serious session with it. It does everything better than I expected especially when it comes to spin, which is actually not that different when compared to using a more &quot;advanced&quot; setup. </p> <p>Speed, power &amp; control are exceptional considering the price point but obviously average when comparing to supposedly better setups. It'll be interesting for me to test the rubbers on an OFF class blade.</p> <p>To sum up, Yinhe Mercury 2 has arguably the best price-performance ratio &amp; is very suitable for those who are on a serious budget &amp; aren't looking for equipment with the highest spin &amp; speed capabilities.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/St_TwerxAlot"> /u/St_TwerxAlot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10ia35l/personal_opinion_on_the_yinhe_mercury_2_rubber/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10ia35l/personal_opinion_on_the_yinhe_mercury_2_rubber/">[comments]</a></span></summary>

      <summary><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys, I'm looking to play at a table tennis tourney in July. I'm currently being coached to improve on my basics such as the forehand push and smash. We do not train with a basket of balls due to reservations by other coaches and limited spots at the club. I would say I'm quite consistent. However, normally 30-45 mins into the training my consistency drops considerably. I find myself gasping for air as my coach pushes me to return harder and lower shots. I get too tired to pace back and forth with my footwork and miss many shots that I would have gotten at resting BPM. When I do get to looping, even with the right technique, there isn't enough strength in the top spin to return the underspin backhand serves. I currently train every other day for three days a week for about a month now. I want to ask the community what I can do in terms of gyming, diet and stationary technique practices to improve my overall endurance and strength threshold? In dire need of counseling. Thank you everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Slamdemcows"> /u/Slamdemcows </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10hbzfh/how_do_i_condition_to_improve_my_endurance_and/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10hbzfh/how_do_i_condition_to_improve_my_endurance_and/">[comments]</a></span></summary>

When comparing these popular rubbers. I would like to put a tackier rubber on the forehand. I’ve been researching for a few hours off and on and just keep getting overwhelmed with terminology and whatnot so I figured I would just ask Reddit for a list I guess. Tacky vs non tacky amongst the highest quality rubbers. </p> <p>Also I always hear about Chinese rubbers being hard. If it’s not too much work maybe a list of very hard rubbers compared to some other popular rubbers that may be considered more spongy. </p> <p>I’m not using this as my personal bat, I know it’ll be impossible to control for most people, price is not an issue. Just want to have a trophy piece of a bat to kind of show off to my friends and to let them play around with high quality equipment.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/anklesock1012"> /u/anklesock1012 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10gnjlc/im_building_a_bat_to_be_my_houses_epic_paddle_i/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10gnjlc/im_building_a_bat_to_be_my_houses_epic_paddle_i/">[comments]</a></span></summary>

      <summary><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The primary club I practice at has a handful of people with a decent variety of play styles and rubbers. The club has about 5 or 6 tables and when I walk in after work, I basically play with whoever is available.</p> <p>One of the players I occasionally find myself playing with is a long pips blocker. LP are on both sides of the racket. Blocks 80% of the time, occasionally punches or drop shots. Decent at hitting to different parts of the table. He’s an older gentleman, so I figure this helps slow down the game for him, but it’s not the most thrilling setup to play against. </p> <p>When these moments happen, I’ve been trying to find things to do to make the playtime more interesting for myself, but I’m looking for other/new ideas.</p> <p>So far, I’ve got two variations of how I handle playing with this person:</p> <ol> <li><p>I call “Wax on, Wax off” which is mostly just a reminder to my body/mind of how LPs work to invert spin. I hit topspin, then push back the backspin that comes back, then drive the topspin, then rinse and repeat until I get a shot that’s too easy to put away or someone makes an error.</p></li> <li><p>I just try to keep cranking up topspin on the ball until one of us makes an error.</p></li> </ol> <p>But like I said, I’m looking for fresh ideas. I may start trying to come up with something to improve based on this guys ability for decent placement and drop shots… but that idea is still in the works.</p> <p>Any thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/NiagebaSaigoALT"> /u/NiagebaSaigoALT </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10g8r3p/ideas_for_practicing_w_lp_blocker/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10g8r3p/ideas_for_practicing_w_lp_blocker/">[comments]</a></span></summary>
