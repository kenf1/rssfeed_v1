I am using Butterfly Free Chack, how many layers of glue should I put on the rubber sponge? Guideline says one layer on rubber, one on the blade, but I saw many videos when someone use 2 layers. Also opinions for pressing the racket after gluing differs, some say to use press or put racket between some heavy books, some do not use any press at all.

    	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tried my friend's setup (similar blade to my own, 5-play all wood) and ended up loving H3 on backhand. This is the red package, not the green-packaged &quot;NEO&quot; version. I had always read you needed some special unobtainable technique to make proper use of this rubber or it would feel &quot;dead&quot;, but it instantly improved several of my techniques.</p> <p>My current setup is a Tibhar Stratus Power Wood blade with Nittaku Fastarc G1 (max) on forehand and Rakza Z (2.0) on backhand. The Rakza Z was bought for forehand but I ended up liking it far more for backhand.</p> <p>The H3 seems to improve on everything I like about the Rakza Z, like the Z was just a gateway-drug to the H3. My short game and flicks are just easier to control with H3. In particular, my banana flick to the opponents forehand corner (right-handed) is significantly easier to land.</p> <p>When stepping back from the table and looping, I found it easier to control, as well. It's slower than what I originally had which was Rakza 7 Soft, but it's not noticeably slower than Rakza Z. Again, I had more control and really had no problem having enough power to hit winners. More confidence will usually result in more power.</p> <p>Here's the big one. Chop-blocks were far more controllable. This one I'm particularly excited about because my chop-blocks are very effective…when they land. Well, they were landing all night with H3.</p> <p>So, my setup is backhand finesse with the H3 and forehand power with the Fastarc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Fidel_Blastro"> /u/Fidel_Blastro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10kbigs/so_i_had_unexpected_results_with_dhs_hurricane_3/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10kbigs/so_i_had_unexpected_results_with_dhs_hurricane_3/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content>

    	<id>Carbon-blade-recommendation-for-penhold</id>
    	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I'm planning to buy a carbon blade for the first time, mostly for experiencing with carbon blade, but I also want to save it as an upgrade of my YEO for playing seriously with once my techniques are more solid. </p> <p>Currently I'm using a YEO with Battle 2 national (39 degree) on FH and Rakza 7 on BH. I don't have a formal rating but guess my level is on the lower intermediate spectrum. My playing style is close to the table with a mix of top spin openings (FH or RPB) and TPB blocks (somewhat passive since I just often wait for the opponent to open first and then use placement block and/or counter, I'm working on playing more active tho). Some of the blades that come to my mind include: - Viscaria CS ver: I had a chance to play with this for abt 5 mins, the feel is very different from my YEO, will need some time to adjust but at least top spins are very satisfying (using 60-70% of my power and it's already as fast as my loop using 90% power with YEO). - Harimoto inner ALC CS ver: Seems to be great at blocking, but not sure about TPB? - Sanwei 75, I'm considering both inner and outer version. - Nittaku acoustic carbon (outer &amp; inner)</p> <p>My budget is around the price of Viscaria. Any input is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/commoner9x"> /u/commoner9x </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10jvqud/carbon_blade_recommendation_for_penhold/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10jvqud/carbon_blade_recommendation_for_penhold/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content>

I've used Medium &amp; Soft on a blade which used to be a premade racket, I'd say it belongs in the ALL+ class.</p> <p>I've assembled the setup for months already but only recently had a more serious session with it. It does everything better than I expected especially when it comes to spin, which is actually not that different when compared to using a more &quot;advanced&quot; setup. </p> <p>Speed, power &amp; control are exceptional considering the price point but obviously average when comparing to supposedly better setups. It'll be interesting for me to test the rubbers on an OFF class blade.</p> <p>To sum up, Yinhe Mercury 2 has arguably the best price-performance ratio &amp; is very suitable for those who are on a serious budget &amp; aren't looking for equipment with the highest spin &amp; speed capabilities.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/St_TwerxAlot"> /u/St_TwerxAlot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10ia35l/personal_opinion_on_the_yinhe_mercury_2_rubber/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10ia35l/personal_opinion_on_the_yinhe_mercury_2_rubber/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content>

T05fx is not giving me enough power on the backhand counter loop from mid distance. Should I consider t05, t19, d05? I like the easy open ups of t05fx but I'm getting constant training and have good technique so I feel like I am ready to get a harder backhand rubber.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/LexusLongshot"> /u/LexusLongshot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10i5ide/t05fx_not_working_on_backhand/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10i5ide/t05fx_not_working_on_backhand/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content>

    	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys, I'm looking to play at a table tennis tourney in July. I'm currently being coached to improve on my basics such as the forehand push and smash. We do not train with a basket of balls due to reservations by other coaches and limited spots at the club. I would say I'm quite consistent. However, normally 30-45 mins into the training my consistency drops considerably. I find myself gasping for air as my coach pushes me to return harder and lower shots. I get too tired to pace back and forth with my footwork and miss many shots that I would have gotten at resting BPM. When I do get to looping, even with the right technique, there isn't enough strength in the top spin to return the underspin backhand serves. I currently train every other day for three days a week for about a month now. I want to ask the community what I can do in terms of gyming, diet and stationary technique practices to improve my overall endurance and strength threshold? In dire need of counseling. Thank you everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Slamdemcows"> /u/Slamdemcows </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10hbzfh/how_do_i_condition_to_improve_my_endurance_and/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/10hbzfh/how_do_i_condition_to_improve_my_endurance_and/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content>
